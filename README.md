This repository is the result of my following the [Tensorflow and Deep Learning without a PhD](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd) tutorial given my [Martin Gorner](https://github.com/martin-gorner). I used the slides and [Martin's source code](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial) to make my own notebooks. I also added some scope naming, with an eye towards looking at these examples in [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in the future.
